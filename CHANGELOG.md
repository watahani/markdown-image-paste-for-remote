### Added

- Improved the file name input validation to restrict the use of forbidden characters, including /, \, :, *, ?, ", <, >, |. This prevents potential issues with the file system or operating system
- When a text is selected in the editor, the extension now uses the selected text as the default file name in the input box. The selected text will be replaced by the generated syntax.
